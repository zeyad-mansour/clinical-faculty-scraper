    "Navigate to the list of faculty in the Anesthesiology Department (be aware that each website is very different. For instance, the links for Upstate and Westchester are already linked to the Anesthesiology program, but you will have to navigate to the faculty page; the New Mexico website has to be filtered first in order to see just the anesthesiology faculty). \n",

    "\n",
    "Once you find the appropriate pages with the faculty listed, I would like you to create an excel file, where each institution as its own sheet. There should be four headers for each sheet: First Name, Last Name, Email, Error. The first name and last name of a clinician should be in the appropriate cell as well as their email (if scrapable). Error should remain blank for now. There should not be any other text in the first name or last name columns (no MD, DO, or any titles, just a single name in each). "
